			<div>The Raspberry Pi Macintosh SE - Project MacPI</div>
			<div>Fall of 2018</div>
			<div>Introduction</div>
			<div>This entire project started from seeing a post on ebay.com for an old IBM PS/2 computer that had been sitting abandoned under a deck in upstate New York for 10+ years. It had a story.
				The display worked, but the logic boards were dead. I looked around Youtube for a bit, and as it turned out, the internal input for these monitors could be directly wired
				to a VGA cable. I knew I wanted to make it functional again, make it modern.</div>
			<div>There was one day left on the item that had been posted for 2 weeks. I bid the minimum. I was outbid almost instantly by $20.</div>
			<div>[The Macintosh SE](1.jpg) After losing the item with the backstory, I settled for a broken Macintosh SE:</div>
			<div>MacPI - The Goals</div>
			<div>
				1) Create a working Raspberry PI inside a Macintosh SE <br/> 
				2) Do not damage the outer casing, this should be a relatively seamless build<br/>
				3) Retain a CRT display - optionally may add color<br/>
				4) Any external buttons should use existing placements or be well concealed<br/>
				5) Should have external input to use as a display<br/>
			</div>
			<div>MacPI - The Plan</div>
			<div>
				1) Remove existing hardware aside from CRT and power supply<br/>
				2) Adapt Raspberry PI HDMI output to function with CRT display<br/>
				3) Mount Raspberry PI and other adapter hardware inside case, powering via a powered USB hub<br/>
				4) Add cooling fan<br/>
				5) Run extenders and other cables to the back of the case, mounting in the expansion slot<br/>
				6) ???<br/>
				7) Profit!<br/>

			<div>MacPI Phase 1: Removing existing hardware, getting new hardware</div>
			<div> [Demonstration of screw hole position](2.jpg) [Torx-15 screwdriver with 12 inch shaft](3.jpg) I began by attempting to open the casing of the Mac. I knew that it would require a Torx-15 bit, which I had. What I didn't realize is that two of the screw holes were at the front of the casing, tucked underneath the handle. A quick trip to the local hardware store landed me a Torx-15 screwdriver with a 12-inch shaft. Apple really didn't want to mess around with CRT safety back then.</div>
			<div>WARNING: This part of the process is fairly dangerous. At this point, before you touch anything, we have to discharge the CRT display. CRTs are basically huge, heavy-duty capacitors, and to prevent getting shocked, we need to discharge it. You will need a flathead screwdriver and wire with alligator clips. Carefully attach one end of the wire to the screwdriver. The other will attach to the metal cord looped around the base of the display, the ground wire.</div>
